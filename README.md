Question:
Three students (a, b, c) are arriving in the mess at the same time. The id numbers of these students are 2132, 2102, 2453 and the food taken time from the mess table is 2, 4 and 8 minutes. If the two students have same remaining time so it is broken by giving priority to the students with the lowest id number. Consider the longest remaining time first (LRTF) scheduling algorithm and calculate the average turnaround time and waiting time.

TurnAround Time:In general, turnaround time means the amount of time taken to complete a process or fulfill a request. The concept thus overlaps with lead time and can be contrasted with cycle time.

Burst Time:The slice that it gets, is called the CPU burst. In simple terms, the duration for which a process gets control of the CPU is the CPU burst time, and the concept of gaining control of the CPU is the CPU burst. Similarly, an I/O burst is the concept of performing I/O operations.
